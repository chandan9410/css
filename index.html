  <p> Chanakya was an epoch-making personality. It was the time when India was
    emerging out of the ‘Dark Age’. The old values were losing their relevance and
    the new were yet to be established. It was an age of confusion, which permeated
    every walk of the society. The Dharma, so far a guiding and uniting force, was
    being subjected to the contradictory interpretations. The factionalism and
    fundamentalism were raising their ugly heads and entering into the vitality of the
    social and religious norms. Taking the advantage of his confusion, Alexander of
    Macedon invaded India with the help of the selfish rulers of some border states.
    Chanakya witnessed and felt the severe trauma of this major invasion by a real
    foreigner. Earlier all the invaders, who attacked us eventually settled in our
    country itself. But Alexander’s invasion was an attack of totally an alien culture
    and army which had strong tradition and strength of their own glorious past. But,
    ironically, this shattering jolt helped efface the prevailing confusion in India and
    expedited the emergence of a new system, which was in essence authored by
    Chanakya.
